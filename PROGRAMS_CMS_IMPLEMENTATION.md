## 🔧 Next Steps to Complete

### High Priority
1. **Team Management** - Create pages similar to initiatives for:
   - `/admin/programs/[id]/team`
   - API routes for team CRUD operations

2. **Program-Specific Pages**:
   - FOSServe: `/admin/programs/[id]/casestudies`
   - FOSSynC: `/admin/programs/[id]/clubs`
   - FOSStorm: `/admin/programs/[id]/projects`
   - FOSSart: `/admin/programs/[id]/startups`
   - FOSSterage: `/admin/programs/[id]/repositories`

3. **Frontend Integration** - Update program pages to fetch from database:
   - `/app/programs/fosstar/page.tsx`
   - `/app/programs/fosserve/page.tsx`
   - etc.

### Medium Priority
4. **Image Upload** - Add media library integration
5. **Bulk Operations** - Import/Export functionality
6. **Search & Filter** - Add search across programs and initiatives
7. **Analytics** - Track program page views and engagement

### Low Priority
8. **Version History** - Track changes to programs
9. **Multi-language** - Support for Telugu/Hindi content
10. **Public API** - Expose program data via REST API

## 🚀 How to Use

### Access the CMS
1. Login to admin at `/admin/login`
2. Navigate to "Programs" in the sidebar
3. You'll see all 7 programs already created

### Add Initiative Example
1. Click on any program (e.g., FOSStar)
2. Click "Manage Initiatives"
3. Click "Add Initiative"
4. Fill in:
   - Title: "Community Benefits"
   - Description: "Access to members-only forums and events"
   - Content: Rich formatted text
   - Category: "benefits"
   - Icon: "Users"
5. Save and see it appear in the list

### Reorder Items
- Use ⬆️ and ⬇️ buttons to reorder
- Changes save automatically
- Order reflects on public pages

## 📝 Code Patterns

### Creating New Management Pages
Follow the pattern in `initiatives/page.tsx`:
1. Fetch program details
2. Fetch items for that program
3. Tabbed interface (Overview/Edit)
4. Form with rich text editor
5. CRUD operations with toasts
6. Reorder functionality

### API Route Pattern
```typescript
GET - List items for program
POST - Create new item for program
PUT - Update item (requires ?id=)
DELETE - Delete item (requires ?id=)
```

### Database Relationships
All sub-resources have:
- `programId` - Foreign key to Program
- `onDelete: Cascade` - Auto-delete when program deleted
- `order` field for sorting
- `active` boolean for visibility

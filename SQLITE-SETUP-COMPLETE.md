## 🔧 Database Management

### View Database (Prisma Studio)

```bash
bunx prisma studio
```

Opens a web interface at `http://localhost:5555` to browse/edit data visually.

### Add More Sample Data

```bash
bun prisma/seed.ts
```

### Reset Database

```bash
bunx prisma migrate reset
```

This will:
1. Drop the database

## 🔐 Next Steps: Add Authentication

The database is ready, but you need to add proper authentication. Here's how:

### Install NextAuth

```bash
bun add next-auth
```

### Create Auth Route

Create `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`:

```typescript
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import CredentialsProvider from "next-auth/providers/credentials"
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"
import bcrypt from "bcryptjs"

export const authOptions = {
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      credentials: {
        email: { type: "email" },
        password: { type: "password" }
      },
      async authorize(credentials) {
        if (!credentials?.email || !credentials?.password) {
          return null
        }

        const admin = await prisma.admin.findUnique({
          where: { email: credentials.email }
        })

        if (!admin) {
          return null
        }

        const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(
          credentials.password,
          admin.password
        )

        if (!isValid) {
          return null
        }

        return {
          id: admin.id,
          email: admin.email,
          name: admin.name,
          role: admin.role
        }
      }
    })
  ],
  pages: {
    signIn: "/admin/login"
  },
  session: { strategy: "jwt" }
}

const handler = NextAuth(authOptions)
export { handler as GET, handler as POST }
```

### Update Login Page

Make it functional with NextAuth (see CMS-README.md for details).

## 📈 Testing the Backend

### Test Member Creation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/members \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "phone": "+91 1234567890",

## 📝 Environment Variables

Your `.env` file should contain:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database locked error
```bash
# Close Prisma Studio if open
# Or delete dev.db and run:
bunx prisma migrate reset
```

### Can't see data
```bash
# Reseed the database
bun prisma/seed.ts
```

### Prisma Client issues
```bash
# Regenerate client
bunx prisma generate
```

### Port already in use
```bash
# Kill process using port 3000
# Windows: netstat -ano | findstr :3000
# Then: taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### For Production (Vercel/Netlify)

1. **Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite**
   - SQLite doesn't work on serverless platforms
   - Use Supabase (free PostgreSQL)
   - Or Neon, PlanetScale, etc.

2. **Update Schema Provider**
```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"  // Change from sqlite
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

3. **Run Migrations**
```bash
bunx prisma migrate deploy
```

4. **Add Environment Variables** in Vercel/Netlify dashboard
